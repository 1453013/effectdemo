A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/ines/pen/MoaRYM.

 Termynal uses async and await, which is now supported pretty much across all major browsers. Termynal lets you write all input and output in plain HTML, and all styling in plain CSS. Non-JS users will still see the complete code, just no animation. It also comes with a flexible HTML API
